## Quality Gates

Generated projects use `make all` as the standard local quality gate. It runs
these targets in order:

- `build`: create the local virtual environment and install development
  dependencies with `uv sync --group dev`.
- `check-fmt`: check Ruff formatting for Python sources and, when Rust is
  enabled, `cargo fmt` for the Rust extension.
- `lint`: run `lint-python` and, when Rust is enabled, `lint-rust`.
- `typecheck`: run `ty check`.
- `test`: run pytest and, when Rust is enabled, Rust tests.
- `spelling`: run the shared `typos-config-builder` gate over tracked Markdown
  to enforce en-GB-oxendict spelling.
- `audit`: run `pip-audit` and, when Rust is enabled, `cargo audit`.

The `lint-python` target runs Ruff, then Interrogate with
`interrogate --fail-under 100 $(PYTHON_TARGETS)` to enforce 100% docstring
coverage for the Python targets, then a pinned Pylint (`PYLINT_VERSION`) on uv-managed PyPy 3.12
(`PYLINT_PYTHON`), installed through `uv tool run`. `syntax-error` stays
enabled, so a module that the interpreter cannot parse fails the lint rather than being
skipped.

The spelling target regenerates `typos.toml` from the live shared dictionary
and the `typos.local.toml` overlay on every run, so `typos.toml` is never drift
checked in continuous integration. Run `make spelling` directly when updating
documentation; an ignored local cache remains usable when the shared source is
temporarily offline.

Pytest discovery is limited to the top-level `tests/` tree. Keep generated
project unit tests there rather than in package module directories or
`unittests/` subdirectories, because CI coverage runs through xdist-backed
SlipCover support.

When the Rust extension is enabled, `lint-rust` runs:

- `cargo doc` with warnings denied;
- `cargo clippy` with the generated Clippy configuration; and
- Whitaker with `whitaker --all`.

The generated Makefile never installs Whitaker; it fails with a clear error
when the wrapper is missing. Install it yourself with `whitaker-installer`
(see <https://github.com/leynos/whitaker>) before running local Rust linting.

## Dependency Auditing

Run `make audit` to check generated project dependencies for known
vulnerabilities. All generated projects run `pip-audit` against the Python
environment created by `uv sync --group dev`. CI skips `make audit` for
Dependabot pull requests; a weekly scheduled audit on the default branch is the
compensating control. Rust-enabled projects also run `cargo audit` from the
`rust_extension` crate directory.



## Rust Test Behaviour

Rust-enabled projects use `cargo nextest run` when `cargo-nextest` is available.
If `cargo-nextest` is not installed, the generated `test` target falls back to
`cargo test`. Rust documentation tests still run through `cargo test --doc`.

If cargo is missing from the local environment, generated Rust test targets fail
early with a clear error instead of falling through to an unusable `cargo`
invocation.

## Local GitHub Actions Validation

The generated Makefile supports optional local workflow validation using
[`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act). When `act` is installed and Docker is
available, pass `WITH_ACT=1` to the `test` target:

```bash
make test WITH_ACT=1
```

This sets `RUN_ACT_VALIDATION=1` for the pytest invocation, enabling the
act-based integration tests that run the generated CI workflow locally.
Omitting `WITH_ACT` (or setting it to `0`) skips act validation; the rest of
the test suite runs unchanged.

## Cleaning Local State

Run `make clean` to remove local build and cache outputs, including `.venv`,
`.uv-cache`, `.uv-tools`, Python cache directories, coverage outputs, and Rust
`target` output when the Rust extension is enabled.
