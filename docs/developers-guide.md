# Developer guide

This guide explains the contributor workflow for the generated project.

The repository currently contains a scaffold. The
[terms of reference](terms-of-reference.md) defines scope, the
[context](context.md) defines vocabulary, and the
[technical design](tech-design.md) defines the proposed compiler and runtime
contracts. The [roadmap](roadmap.md) sequences their implementation; unchecked
tasks represent future work. The [repository layout](repository-layout.md)
distinguishes current files from proposed paths.

The reference generated package lives at `generated/setwork/cuprum`, as shown
in section 5.3 of the [technical design](tech-design.md). Its contents remain
package-root-relative in generated package examples.

## Local workflow

The public entrypoint for formatting, linting, typechecking, tests, and
spelling is `make all`. Narrower Make targets may be invoked when investigating
a specific failure, and changes should be reconciled with the aggregate gate
before being considered complete.

`make lint` runs Ruff, `interrogate --fail-under 100 $(PYTHON_TARGETS)` for
100% docstring coverage across `$(PYTHON_TARGETS)`, classic Pylint on PyPy
8.0.0 (Python 3.12.14), and `df12-python-lints` on CPython 3.14. Both Pylint
passes use isolated uv tool environments with Pylint 4.0.9 and `astroid` 4.0.4;
the DF12 plugin is pinned to `v0.3.0`. Runtime verification targets reject an
incorrect interpreter before linting. `PYLINT_PYTHON` and `DF12_PYTHON` may be
overridden with compatible interpreter paths; `PYLINTHOME` caches are separate.
uv installs the managed interpreters automatically when required. The lint
baseline remains Python 3.12, matching `requires-python`.

`make typecheck` runs `ty`, pinned in the dev dependency group (`ty==0.0.56`):
unpinned installations broke repositories when ty 0.0.56 landed. Bump the pin
deliberately — update the version and fix any new diagnostics in the same pull
request.

Run `make audit` as the dependency vulnerability gate. It runs `pip-audit` for
Python dependencies, and Rust-enabled projects also run `cargo audit` from the
`rust_extension` crate directory.

## Automation scripts

The [Scripting standards](scripting-standards.md) document provides guidance
for adding or updating helper scripts. New and updated scripts are expected to
use `Cyclopts` for command-line interfaces, `cuprum` for typed and
catalogue-bound external command execution, `pathlib` for filesystem paths, and
`cmd-mox` for tests that mock external executables.

Script changes should update the scripting guide when they introduce a new
convention, command catalogue, testing pattern, or operational expectation that
future contributors need to follow.

## GitHub Actions

The generated repository includes GitHub Actions workflows and local composite
actions under `.github/`.

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on pushes to `main` and on pull requests. It
  sets up Python 3.13, installs `uv`, validates the generated `Makefile` with
  `mbake`, runs `make build`, `make check-fmt`, `make lint` (Ruff +
  `interrogate --fail-under 100 $(PYTHON_TARGETS)` + Pylint +
  `df12-python-lints`), `make typecheck`, `make spelling`, and `make audit`
  except for Dependabot pull requests via
  `if: github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]'`, then delegates coverage generation
  to the shared coverage action. When the Rust extension is enabled, it also
  sets up Rust, installs Rust lint and test tools, and passes
  `rust_extension/Cargo.toml` to coverage.
- `.github/workflows/audit.yml` runs `make audit` against the default branch
  weekly as the compensating control for the Dependabot CI bypass.
- `.github/workflows/act-validation.yml` runs rendered workflow validation in a
  separate workflow. It installs `act`, checks Docker availability, and runs
  `make test WITH_ACT=1` outside the coverage path.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` publishes wheels when a `v*.*.*` tag is
  pushed. It builds a pure Python wheel, creates a GitHub release with
  generated release notes, downloads wheel artefacts, and uploads them to the
  tag release.
- `.github/workflows/build-wheels.yml` is a reusable workflow for extension
  builds. It accepts a Python version and builds wheels across Linux, Windows,
  and macOS architectures via `.github/actions/build-wheels`.
- `.github/workflows/get-codescene-sha.yml` is manually dispatched. It fetches
  the CodeScene coverage CLI installer, computes its SHA-256 digest, and writes
  the result to the `CODESCENE_CLI_SHA256` repository variable.

- `.github/actions/build-wheels` wraps `cibuildwheel` with `uvx` and uploads
  architecture-specific wheel artefacts.
- `.github/actions/pure-python-wheel` builds a pure Python wheel with
  `uv build --wheel` and uploads the resulting artefact.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` enables dependency update pull requests for GitHub
  Actions and Python packages. Rust-enabled projects also receive Cargo updates.

The `CS_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret must be configured when CodeScene coverage upload
is required. The `CODESCENE_CLI_SHA256` variable should be populated using the
refresh workflow, so CI can verify the downloaded CodeScene installer before
upload.

## Shared spelling configuration

Run `make spelling` to enforce en-GB-oxendict spelling. The shared
`typos-config-builder` gate regenerates `typos.toml` from the live estate
dictionary in `leynos/agent-helper-scripts` and the `typos.local.toml` overlay
on every run, then checks tracked Markdown. A word added to the shared
dictionary therefore needs no change here, and `typos.toml` must never be drift
checked in continuous integration. `typos.toml` is therefore a generated
artefact and is ignored by Git, as is the local cache that keeps the gate
usable when the authority is temporarily unreachable. Add only narrow
project-specific terms and exclusions to `typos.local.toml`; never edit
generated `typos.toml` by hand.

## Shared documentation library

The complexity guide, documentation style guide, local Actions validation
guide, and scripting standards are verbatim imports from the
[shared documentation library](https://github.com/leynos/agent-helper-scripts/tree/main/documentation-library)
at revision `8b6d0414675d19d4045b0336ec2166d94569816d`. Refresh these
documents by replacing them with the library versions; record project-specific
guidance in this guide.
